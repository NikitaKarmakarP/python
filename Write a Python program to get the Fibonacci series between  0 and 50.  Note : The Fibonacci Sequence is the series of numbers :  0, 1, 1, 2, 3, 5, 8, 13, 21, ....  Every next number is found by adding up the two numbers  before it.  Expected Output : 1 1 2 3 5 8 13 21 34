CODE: 
# Initialize the first two terms of the Fibonacci sequence 
fibonacci_series = [0, 1] 
 
# Generate Fibonacci numbers until the next number exceeds 
50 
while True: 
    next_fibonacci = fibonacci_series[-1] + fibonacci_series[-2] 
     
    if next_fibonacci > 50: 
        break 
     
    fibonacci_series.append(next_fibonacci) 
 
# Print the Fibonacci series 
print("Fibonacci series between 0 and 50:") 
for num in fibonacci_series: 
    print(num, end=" ") 
 
OUTPUT: 
Fibonacci series between 0 and 50: 
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
